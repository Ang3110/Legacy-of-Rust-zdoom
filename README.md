# Legacy-of-Rust-zdoom-custom-edition
This project brings ZDoom-close compatibility and development features to ZDoombased source ports that don't supposrt mbf21, such as Zandronum, LZDoom, ZDoom, but can also work in gzdoom despite having mbf21 support. It translates and adapts the legacy of LoR Enhanced content into the ZDoom ecosystem while keeping it the same.
