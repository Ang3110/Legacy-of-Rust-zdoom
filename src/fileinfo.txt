              Patch Notes
==================================

Version: 1.3

Highlights:
-----------
- DecoHack from id1.wad has been translated into ZDoomDecorate to closely simulate the original behavior seen in the KEX Engine version.

Changes and Additions:
----------------------
- Added impassable linedefs to clipable fences, improving map accuracy.
- placed action 88 to the stair's linedef to trigger tag 52 in map13/E2M6 since ghouls could not trigger them in their boxed enclosure. this will do for now.
- Converted UMAPINFO to ZMAPINFO for enhanced compatibility with ZDoom-based ports.
- Introduced the animated PlayStation Doom sky to the following maps:
  ~ Maps 6, 7, 12, and 14.
- Implemented GLDEFS and brightmaps for dynamic lighting effects, adding visual polish to the decorations and enemies.
- intermission map screen
- new end game monster credits

Notes:
------
- This update aims to bring the Legacy of Rust experience closer to its KEX Engine counterpart while leveraging the advanced capabilities of ZDoom-based source ports zandronum up to lzdoom.
- feel free to add, remove, or change things as long as any of the code used from this file is credited.  Hope to see some cool mods out of it.
