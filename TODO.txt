TODO List

1. Map-Specific Issues
----------------------
- Map 13:
  - Problem: Ghouls are not triggering action 88 linedef for tag 52 because it only applies to ground-based enemies.
  - Temporary Fix: Placed the action linedef by the stairs for now.

- Map 10:
  - Possible Bug: The last 4 monsters might not spawn. Double-check spawn points or scripts.

2. Ambient Sound Integration
----------------------------
- Maps 1 and 14:
  - Task: Add ambient sounds for portal open and close actions.
  - Note: Might need to convert some maps to UDMF format to use ambient like scripts, but sticking to Boom format for now.

3. Map Validation
-----------------
- No Known Fixes Needed (Pending Double Check):
  - Maps: 4, 7â€“12, 16.
  - Task: Review these maps for potential bugs or missing elements.

   4. Deh_actor issue
-----------------
 - The actors with their editor numbers work in all ZDoom-based ports.  However, in LZDoom and GZDoom, an error is detected where the editor numbers,
 as suggested in the id1.wad file, repeat the class twice in 'actor' and 'Deh_Actor_(number)'. This could be id1.wad interfering.
  
   5. Optional but not needed
-----------------
- implement intermission map screen like  in doom 1
	- arrows wont switch sides accordingly, maybe because its doom2?
	- in zandronum and zdoom intermission screen forces it to 5:3 ration even if the graphics are widescreen friendly or on a ratio higher than 5:3 does not stretch to its appropriate size/ratio,
	hence the arrow pointer's coordination being off.
	It works in LZdoom and GZdoom just fine.
